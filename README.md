## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB
- State Management: Redux
- Styling: CSS Modules

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. Frontend (`/src`)
   - Components
   - Redux store
   - API services

2. Backend (`/my-backend`)
   - Express server
   - MongoDB models
   - API routes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-learning-system-manager.git
   cd quiz-learning-system-manager
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   cd my-backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and in the `my-backend` directory with the necessary environment variables.

4. Start the development server
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   In a separate terminal:
   ```
   cd my-backend
   npm start
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production

## Database Schema

The application uses MongoDB with the following main collections:

- Users: Stores user information and authentication details
- Quizzes: Contains quiz metadata and questions
- Attempts: Records user attempts and scores for each quiz

For more details, refer to the `quizModel.js` file in the backend.

## API Endpoints

The backend provides RESTful API endpoints for:

- User management (registration, login, profile updates)
- Quiz CRUD operations
- Quiz attempt submission and retrieval
- Analytics and reporting

Detailed API documentation can be found in the `/docs` directory.
